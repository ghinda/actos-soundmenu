actos-soundmenu
===============

Very simple Sound Menu plasmoid with volume and playback (MPRIS) controls for the current media player.

Meant to be used as a lightweight replacement for the default KMix systray plasmoid.

After installation, you can enable it in the System Tray settings, under *Extra Items*.


Development
-----------

Run with

```
plasmoidviewer
```


Install
-------

Install it on the KDE Plasma Desktop using the *Get New Widgets* dialog, from *Add Widgets*.
